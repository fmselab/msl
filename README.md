# MSL: MAPE Specification Language

## Introduction
In architecture-based self-adaptation, the adaptation logic is usually structured in terms of MAPE-K (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute over a shared Knowledge) loops dealing with the adaptation concerns of the managed system. In case of large, complex and decentralized systems, multiple interacting MAPE loops are introduced. Some common design patterns of interactive MAPE loops have been proposed in the [literature](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-35813-5_4).

MAPE Specification Language (MSL) allows to describe MAPE patterns in a precise and unambiguous way.

The MSL language's semantics is formally defined trough a *semantic mapping* that transforms MSL models of MAPE pattern instances into formal executable descriptions based on the framework of *self-adaptive Abstract State Machines* (see [related paper](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3019598)).
The model generator **MSL2ASM** implements such a mapping, i.e., it transforms an MSL model into a self-adaptive ASM model (written in the textual notation AsmetaL) automatically. The produced ASM model can be used for formal analysis using the [ASMETA framework](http://asmeta.sourceforge.net/).
